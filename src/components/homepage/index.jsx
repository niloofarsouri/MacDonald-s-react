                    Important Note :
                    At McDonald's, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our customers each and every
                    time they visit our restaurants. We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and
                    considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those customers with
                    food allergies. As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information
                    available from our food suppliers for the nine most common allergens as identified by the U.S. Food and Drug
                    Administration (eggs, dairy, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame), so that our guests
                    with food allergies can make informed food selections. However, we also want you to know that despite taking
                    precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and
                    utensils, and the possibility exists for your food items to come in contact with other food products,
                    including allergens. We encourage our customers with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit
                    www.mcdonalds.com for ingredient information, and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their
                    diet. If you have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly using our contact us forms.

                    Percent Daily Values (DV) and RDIs are based on unrounded values.

                    **Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower
                    depending on your calorie needs.

                    The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted in accredited laboratories,
                    published resources, or from information provided from McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is
                    based on standard product formulations and serving sizes. Calories for fountain beverages are based on
                    standard fill levels plus ice. If you use the self-service fountain inside the restaurant for your drink
                    order, see the sign posted at the beverage fountain for beverage calories without ice. All nutrition
                    information is based on average values for ingredients and is rounded in accordance with current U.S. FDA
                    NLEA regulations. Variation in serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of supply,
                    as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the nutrition values for each product. In addition,
                    product formulations change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient content of the
                    products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market. McDonaldâ€™s USA does not
                    certify or claim any of its US menu items as Halal, Kosher or meeting any other religious requirements. We
                    do not promote any of our US menu items as vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. This information is correct as
                    of January 2022, unless stated otherwise.
